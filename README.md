# The EMC {code} community
We realize that there are many components to having a successful community around open source software projects. Written code is only the first of many, and at times it's not even the most important. Our community is built around the code that EMC {code} and its community works on and enhances, and is not limited to just EMC software. An online community, just like physical communities, evolves and makes itself better for the benefit and value of its members. If it stops evolving, it ceases to be valuable.

We want you in our community! If you're interested in anything related to EMC {code} or any of the projects we're working on in the community (containers, automation, virtualization, monitoring, logging, you name it!), weâ€™d love to have you and make your voice heard. The easiest way to get in contact with fellow EMC {code} members is to join our [Slack team](http://community.emccode.com), or meet us at conferences and meetups (list of where we can be found will come later).
