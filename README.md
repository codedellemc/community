# The {code} community

We realize that there are many components to having a successful community around open source software projects. Written code is only the first of many, and at times it's not even the most important. Our community is built around the code that {code} and its community works on and enhances, and is not limited to just Dell EMC software. An online community, just like physical communities, evolves and makes itself better for the benefit and value of its members. If it stops evolving, it ceases to be valuable.

We want you in our community! If you're interested in anything related to {code} by Dell EMC or any of the projects we're working on in the community (containers, automation, virtualization, monitoring, logging, you name it!), weâ€™d love to have you and make your voice heard.

The easiest way to get in contact with fellow {code} members is to join our [Slack community](http://codedellemc.com/community), or meet us at conferences and meetups ([check out our calendar here](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=52rlkjj3h1lsfqmi5hr0475ceg%40group.calendar.google.com)).

By joining our online community you agree to our [Code of Conduct](docs/code-of-conduct.md).

## Thank you
