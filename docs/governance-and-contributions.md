# Governance and Contributions

{code} by Dell EMC is a community-based program run for the purpose of enhancing and engaging open source communities. Activities are focused on facilitating and mentoring contributions to open source projects while also having a focus on certain open source technologies that align to EMC areas of interest.  As we are only starting out as a program we do not have a formal governance process, however we do have the following structure:

The {code} Maintainers have the final say on what contributions are accepted or not. That said, the {code} Maintainers are open to hearing your thoughts on what should and should not be part of {code} projects and [DevHigh5 contributions](devhigh5.md).  Please share your thoughts or contribution ideas in the following ways:

## New Projects:
Proposals for new projects to be hosted on {code} should be sent to [emccode@emc.com](mailto:emccode@emc.com).

Contributions to {code} can be done in many ways, and are defined by the following sets of standards for anyone wanting to contribute.

### Documentation
No Dell EMC review except from the Maintainers needed.

### Script
Projects using methods of leveraging published APIs or other methods of communications, examples of this could be a Python script, Puppet module, Chef recipe etc. No Dell EMC review except from the Maintainers needed.

### Bugfix
Fixing a bug in a public project, including but not limited to contributions such as fixes for incompatibilities, additions to the code base that increases the functionality of the code, and rework of code that increases the efficiency. This is usually a contribution to an existing project and not a new project. No Dell EMC review except from the Maintainers needed.
